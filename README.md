# DIMC-Design-and-Integration-with-Vector-Processors
This presentation explores the integration of Digital In-Memory Computing (DIMC) as an accelerator within a design of RISC-V ISA matrix instructions. We will cover the design, implementation, and future improvements of this neural engine accelerator.
